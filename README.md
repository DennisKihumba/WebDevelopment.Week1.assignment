# 🧠 Chess Principles Web Page

This project is an educational, beginner-friendly HTML webpage designed to teach the foundational principles of chess, spanning the three main phases of the game: **Opening**, **Middle Game**, and **Endgame**.

## 🌟 Purpose

To provide students, beginners, or fellow chess enthusiasts with a clean, structured guide to key concepts in chess strategy and tactics. It aims to support critical thinking, pattern recognition, and strategic planning—especially in mentorship or classroom settings.
